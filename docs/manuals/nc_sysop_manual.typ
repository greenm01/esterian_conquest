= Introduction

Nostrian Conquest is a multi-player strategy game inspired by a DOS-era BBS
classic and reimplemented in Rust for modern systems. The Rust-native stack
provides the game engine, player client, and admin tooling for modern hosts.

This manual is for the *sysop* — the person responsible for hosting a game
instance. It covers:

- choosing the right deployment path
- creating and maintaining a DB-only game
- running the recommended Nostr host
- running a local or direct SSH game
- putting `nc-door` on a BBS
- managing players and yearly maintenance

For player-facing rules and gameplay, see the *Player Manual*.

This manual is the authoritative sysop manual for the Rust edition of
Nostrian Conquest. The preserved original `.DOC` set in `original/v1.5/`
remains historical reference material and an ambiguity fallback for classic
operator intent, not a higher-authority replacement for the current Rust
manuals.


// ─── 2. Getting Started: Hosting a Campaign ───────────────────────────────────

= Getting Started: Hosting a Campaign

== System Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Rust toolchain (stable) for normal localhost builds
- A terminal emulator for localhost play
- A BBS server with socket support only if you specifically want legacy door
  deployment

== Building from Source

From the repository root:

```
cargo build --release -p nc-sysop -p nc-game
```

The release binaries will be in `target/release/`.

== Current Beta Distribution

During the current beta, public GitHub Releases include Windows x64, Windows
x86 (32-bit), Windows 7+ x86 (32-bit), and Linux x64 `nc-sysop` BBS/sysop
packages.

Keep the binary roles straight.

`nc-game` is the direct localhost session client. `nc-door` is the BBS door
entrypoint on Windows and Linux. `nc-sysop` is the administrator's tool for
creation, settings, reservations, and maintenance.

For the Rust edition:

1. BBS sysops can use the public `nc-sysop` package on Linux x64 or Windows
   x64, or build from tagged source with Cargo.
2. Localhost sysops build from tagged source with Cargo and run `nc-game`
   directly.

The public Nostrian packages do not bundle preserved Esterian Conquest
executables, manuals, or DOS helper assets.

== Choose Your Deployment

NC currently has two practical ways to run the Rust game.

=== Localhost Session

Use this when a sysop wants direct same-machine play for himself, hotseat
testing, or a small trusted session.

1. Build the binaries from source.
2. Create a game directory with `nc-sysop new-game`.
3. Run `nc-game` directly.
4. Run `nc-sysop maint` when the year should advance.

The simplest localhost setup is:

```
nc-sysop new-game /home/sysop/nc-games/friday-night --name "Friday Night NC" --players 4
nc-game --dir /home/sysop/nc-games/friday-night --player 1
```

=== BBS Door Host

Use this when the sysop wants `nc-door` as a door under Mystic, ENiGMA½, or a
similar BBS.

1. Create the game directory.
2. Write a minimal per-game `config.kdl` with `players` and any fixed-seat
   `reservations`.
3. Initialize it with `nc-sysop new-game --bbs`.
4. Launch `nc-door` with a BBS dropfile.
5. Keep maintenance outside the door. Run `nc-sysop maint` from the host or
   the BBS event runner.

For BBS hosting, use the public `nc-sysop` package or build from source.
Localhost play remains a source-build path.

For the exact launcher setups, see:

- `docs/sysop/bbs/mystic-bbs-setup.md`
- `docs/sysop/bbs/enigma-bbs-setup.md`
- `docs/sysop/bbs/synchronet-bbs-setup.md`
- `docs/sysop/bbs/wwiv-bbs-setup.md`

== Game Directory Layout

Direct `nc-game` campaigns are DB-only:

```
/path/to/mygame/
  ncgame.db
```

BBS door campaigns keep a minimal live config file beside the runtime DB:

```
/path/to/mygame/
  config.kdl
  ncgame.db
```

All tools take `--dir /path/to/mygame` to locate the game.

== Initializing a New Game

Create a new game with `nc-sysop new-game`:

```
sudo -u ncgame nc-sysop new-game /srv/nc/games/friday-night --name "Friday Night NC" --players 4
```

This creates one runtime file: `ncgame.db`.

For BBS door campaigns, write `config.kdl` first and then initialize with:

```
nc-sysop new-game --bbs /path/to/mygame
```

The supported public creation flags are:

- *`--name`:* String. Optional game title stored in `ncgame.db`. If omitted,
  `nc-sysop` derives a title from the directory slug.
- *`--players`:* Integer. Number of empires. Supported range: `1-25`. Default:
  `4`.
- *`--seed`:* Integer. Optional campaign RNG seed. It controls map layout,
  starting positions, and all random events. If omitted, the engine picks a
  random seed and saves it to `ncgame.db`. The seed cannot be changed after
  creation.
- *`--bbs`:* Flag. Initialize a BBS campaign from an existing per-game
  `config.kdl`. In this mode, `--name` and `--players` are not accepted on the
  command line. Use `--seed` only if you intentionally want a reproducible map
  for that one campaign.

#admonition("NOTE")[Use a different seed for every game. Reusing the same seed produces the same map, starting positions, and event sequence every time. For BBS campaigns, keep that override on the `new-game --bbs --seed ...` command line instead of storing it in `config.kdl`.]

The target directory basename becomes the stable game slug. It must use only
lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and dashes. The slug is distinct from the
human-readable `game_name`.

== Hosted / Nostr Status

The earlier SSH/Nostr hosted path is no longer part of the active public sysop
surface. `nc-sysop` no longer exposes `host`, `maint-all`, or `nostr`
subcommands, and this manual no longer treats that stack as current operator
workflow.

If hosted play returns later, it should do so as a separate `nc-daemon` /
`nc-dash` architecture with its own docs. Until then, treat the remaining
material in `docs/nostr/` as design/archive content, not live operator
instructions.

// ─── 3. Game Directory Structure ─────────────────────────────────────────────

= Game Directory Structure

/ `ncgame.db`: The SQLite runtime database. All game state lives here. Do not
  edit it by hand.

/ `config.kdl`: Present only for BBS door campaigns. It holds `players` and
  optional seat `reservations`.

// ─── 4. Configuration ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= Configuration <configuration>

Keep these two paths separate:

=== Direct `nc-game`

- Live state: per-game `ncgame.db`
- Runtime path: `nc-game --dir ... --player ...` on localhost
- Operator rule: use the normal `nc-sysop settings ...` surface and schedule
  `nc-sysop maint` yourself

=== BBS Door Host

- Live state: per-game `config.kdl` plus `ncgame.db`
- Runtime path: `nc-door` with a dropfile; ENiGMA½ also passes `--socket-port`
  and Windows Synchronet passes `--socket-descriptor`
- Operator rule: BBS `config.kdl` supports only `players` and `reservations`;
  `settings set` does not apply
- Common hosts: Mystic, ENiGMA½, and Synchronet on Windows or Linux

Use `nc-sysop settings ...` to inspect any non-BBS campaign:

```
nc-sysop settings show --dir /srv/nc/games/friday-night
nc-sysop settings set --dir /srv/nc/games/friday-night --game-name "Friday Night NC"
nc-sysop settings reserve --dir /srv/nc/games/friday-night --player 1 --alias SYSOP
```

For the full non-BBS settings reference, including the raw `settings show`
shape and the advanced carried-forward state fields, see
`docs/sysop/rust/campaign-settings.md`.

=== BBS `config.kdl`

BBS campaigns use a minimal live per-game `config.kdl` instead of the non-BBS
settings surface:

```kdl
players 4
reservations {
  seat player=1 alias="SYSOP"
  seat player=2 alias="NightShade"
}
```

Supported BBS fields are only:

- `players`
- `reservations`

`nc-sysop settings show --dir /path/to/mygame` reports BBS campaigns in a
different shape:

```text
mode=bbs
players=4
reservation seat=1 alias=SYSOP
reservation seat=2 alias=NightShade
```

Do not put `game_name`, `theme`, `snoop`, `session`, `inactivity`, or
`maintenance` in the BBS file. Do not put `seed` there either. It is a one-shot
`new-game` command line override, not live BBS config.

For BBS campaigns, `nc-sysop settings reserve` and `settings unreserve` edit
this file for you. `settings set` is a non-BBS command surface.

== Display Defaults

The default display look is controlled by `default_theme_key`. That key names a
compiled-in color set. It is not a file path.

Players may still choose a local color theme inside `nc-game`. That choice is
stored in `ncgame.db` as a player preference.

In BBS door mode, `nc-door` does not use `default_theme_key` at runtime. Door
sessions always force the bundled `mag16` palette so ANSI16 terminals and BBS
clients get a predictable color-safe baseline.

// ─── 6. Terminal Access ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= Terminal Access

`nc-game` is a direct terminal client. The primary supported path is local
same-machine play, but if you manually remote into a trusted shell and launch
`nc-game` there, it behaves the same way. No special hosted/session flags are
required.

Color mode is auto-detected from the environment:

- `COLORTERM=truecolor` → 24-bit RGB
- `TERM` containing `256color` → 256-color
- Otherwise → 16-color ANSI fallback

Force a specific mode with `--color-mode` if your terminal setup does not
propagate
`COLORTERM` reliably:

```
nc-game --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1 --color-mode 256
```

UTF-8 encoding (the default) is correct for modern terminals. Use
`--encoding cp437` only if you are proxying through a BBS or a CP437 terminal
emulator over SSH.

// ─── 7. Localhost Session Setup ───────────────────────────────────────────────

= Localhost Session Setup

Localhost play remains a fully supported mode for solo campaigns, hotseat
sessions, and sysop testing. Run `nc-game` directly in your terminal:

```
nc-game --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1
```

Color mode and encoding default to `auto` / `utf8`, which is correct for
modern terminal emulators. The client detects `COLORTERM` and `TERM`
automatically.

// ─── 8. BBS Door Setup ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= BBS Door Setup

`nc-door` is the standard BBS entrypoint on Windows and Linux. Use it when the
host is a BBS. Keep `nc-game` for direct localhost sessions. In door mode,
`nc-door` uses CP437 and 16-color ANSI for classic terminal clients.

== Flags for Door Mode

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/DOOR32.SYS --encoding cp437 --color-mode ansi16
```

`--encoding cp437` switches box-drawing characters and other extended
characters to the CP437 code page, which is required for correct rendering
in classic ANSI-aware BBS terminals (SyncTERM, NetRunner, etc.).

When `--encoding cp437` is active, `--color-mode` defaults to `ansi16`
automatically. Override only if you know your BBS clients support a richer
color depth.

Door sessions also force the bundled `mag16` theme regardless of the campaign's
normal `default_theme_key`. The in-game *A>nsi color ON/OFF* command toggles
between that ANSI16 palette and a greyscale monochrome projection.

== Drop File

`nc-door` can read a BBS drop file directly with `--dropfile <path>`:

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/DOOR32.SYS
```

Supported drop file formats (auto-detected by filename, case-insensitive):

- `DOOR32.SYS` — modern standard (Enigma, Mystic, Talisman, etc.)
- `DOOR.SYS` — legacy, widest BBS software support
- `CHAIN.TXT` — WWIV format

The drop file supplies the player alias and session time limit. Explicit CLI
flags always override drop file values. When `--dropfile` is given and
`--encoding` is not, encoding defaults to `cp437` automatically.

`--timeout <minutes>` sets a session time limit independently of a drop file.

Reserve seats in the BBS campaign's `config.kdl` when you want the caller
alias to determine the empire automatically. You can either edit the file
directly or use:

```sh
nc-sysop settings reserve --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1 --alias SYSOP
nc-sysop settings reserve --dir /path/to/mygame --player 2 --alias NightShade
```

With that in place, a reserved caller can launch with `--dropfile` alone.
If the caller alias is not reserved, `nc-door` still uses the same
dropfile-only door flow:

- if the alias already matches a stored joined player handle, that caller
  resumes the matching empire automatically
- if the alias does not match an existing joined empire, the caller lands on
  the BBS first-time menu and can claim the lowest-numbered open unreserved
  empire only when the join is actually confirmed
- if the game is full, the caller still reaches the BBS first-time menu, but
  `J` is refused with the normal no-open-empires notice

#admonition("NOTE")[
  The original DOS `ECGAME.EXE` v1.5 expects a strict 32-line WWIV-style
  `CHAIN.TXT` drop file. Enigma BBS-generated `DOOR.SYS` / `DORINFO` files
  will crash `ECGAME.EXE`. See the legacy DOS compatibility section in
  `docs/sysop/bbs/enigma-bbs-setup.md` if you need to host the original
  binary.
]

== Modern BBS Hosts

The native Rust `nc-door` binary is now verified on Mystic, ENiGMA½, and
Synchronet, and WWIV now has a validated Linux path. The shared core launch
shape is simple: pass `--dir` and a dropfile. ENiGMA½ also passes
`--socket-port`, and Windows Synchronet also passes `--socket-descriptor`.
The helper wrapper at `tools/bbs/run_nc_rust.sh` remains useful only for
source-tree testing and is not the normal packaged door path.

Mystic uses the direct dropfile path:

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/DOOR32.SYS
```

ENiGMA½ uses the same dropfile plus its temporary localhost socket server:

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/DOOR32.SYS --socket-port {srvPort}
```

Windows Synchronet also passes the inherited socket descriptor:

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile %f --socket-descriptor %H
```

Linux Synchronet is validated with the same `DOOR32` dropfile shape. If
your Synchronet install mangles a long native `cmd=` line, keep the full
`nc-door --dir ... --dropfile ...` invocation inside a tiny wrapper and pass
only `%f` into that wrapper.

WWIV is documented separately as a validated Linux `CHAIN.TXT` path:

```
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/CHAIN.TXT
```

Treat native Windows WWIV as unvalidated for now. In one local Windows 11 test
with an older 2023 WWIV Windows package, Defender quarantined the downloaded
binary and `bbs.exe` then crashed before login in both remote and local-node
flows.

For the exact launcher setups, see
`docs/sysop/bbs/mystic-bbs-setup.md`,
`docs/sysop/bbs/enigma-bbs-setup.md`,
`docs/sysop/bbs/synchronet-bbs-setup.md`, and
`docs/sysop/bbs/wwiv-bbs-setup.md`.

// ─── 9. File-Based Turn Submission ──────────────────────────────────────────

= File-Based Turn Submission

For localhost, shared-host, or custom-client workflows, players can submit
orders by writing a KDL turn file and passing it to `nc-game submit-turn`.
Use `--check` to validate without writing, then run without it to apply:

```
nc-game submit-turn --check --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1 --file /path/to/player1-turn.kdl
nc-game submit-turn --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1 --file /path/to/player1-turn.kdl
```

The `--player` value must match the `turn player=...` header in the file. If
any order in the file is invalid, the entire submission is rejected and nothing
is written. This is a direct apply command, not a queue or upload inbox.

A minimal turn file:

```kdl
turn player=1 year=3000
tax rate=37
```

A fuller example:

```kdl
turn player=1 year=3000

tax rate=37

planet record=16 {
  build points=4 kind="scout"
}

fleet record=1 {
  order speed=3 kind="scout_system" x=16 y=13
}

message to=2 subject="Border" body="Watching the north lane."
```

For the full node reference and schema, see `docs/sysop/rust/turn-kdl.md`.

// ─── 10. Turn Processing and Maintenance ─────────────────────────────────────

= Turn Processing and Maintenance

Run yearly maintenance with:

```
nc-sysop maint /path/to/mygame [turns]
```

`nc-sysop maint` advances the campaign in `ncgame.db` immediately. It does not
change the schedule fields. NC does not schedule maintenance by itself. For
one direct localhost game or one BBS game, invoke
`nc-sysop maint` from your own scheduler or event tooling:

- a `systemd` timer
- `cron`
- a BBS event runner
- or manual sysop operation

To put one hosted game on a real schedule, turn scheduling on and set the
first due time yourself:

```
nc-sysop settings set --dir /srv/nc/games/friday-night --maintenance-enabled on --maintenance-interval-minutes 10080 --maintenance-next-due 1775347200
```

That example enables weekly scheduling. `10080` is seven days in minutes.
`1775347200` is just a sample Unix timestamp. Replace it with the first due
time you actually want.

Treat these schedule fields as optional metadata. They do not create their own
timer. They are not BBS `config.kdl` fields. If you run a direct localhost
game, you can ignore them and schedule `maint
/path/to/mygame` yourself.

// ─── 11. Player Management ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= Player Management

Non-BBS campaigns keep player reservations and the carried-forward
inactivity-related state in `ncgame.db`. BBS door campaigns do not use a
separate inactivity block in `config.kdl`; caller idle handling belongs to the
BBS software.

For direct DB-only campaigns, the default inactivity autopilot
threshold is `3` turns. Set `inactivity_autopilot_after_turns=0` if you want
that policy disabled. A player is treated as active for the year by either
reaching the live `nc-game` menus or successfully applying a `submit-turn`
file.

== Reserving Seats

To reserve empire slots for specific BBS users, edit the per-game BBS
`config.kdl` or use:

```sh
nc-sysop settings reserve --dir /path/to/mygame --player 1 --alias SYSOP
nc-sysop settings reserve --dir /path/to/mygame --player 2 --alias NightShade
```

Each `seat` entry binds one 1-based empire slot to one caller alias. Alias
matching is ASCII case-insensitive, so `NightShade`, `nightshade`, and
`NIGHTSHADE` are treated as the same reservation.

With reservations in place, launch `nc-door` with `--dropfile` and let the
caller alias choose the empire automatically:

```sh
nc-door --dir /path/to/mygame --dropfile /path/to/DOOR32.SYS
```

Important rules:

- if the caller alias is reserved, `--dropfile` alone is enough
- if the caller alias is not reserved and already matches a stored joined
  player handle, that caller resumes the matching empire automatically
- if the caller alias is not reserved and does not match an existing joined
  player handle, the caller starts on the BBS first-time menu
- if a reservation conflicts with an already-stored different player handle, `nc-door` will stop with a clear error so the sysop can reconcile the reservation and the runtime state
- if no open unreserved empires remain, `J` from the BBS first-time menu is
  refused and the caller stays on that menu

Reserving a seat does not by itself join or pre-name the empire. It only
routes the caller to the intended slot. The usual first-time join flow still
claims an empire only on successful join confirmation, and that first
successful join records the caller alias into the player record for later
dropfile logins.

For localhost and direct console play, use `nc-game` and follow the localhost
setup section earlier in this manual instead of the BBS dropfile path.

// ─── 12. Terminology ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= Terminology

/ game directory: The directory containing `ncgame.db` for one running game.
  Passed to all tools with `--dir`.

/ `nc-sysop`: The public Rust command-line sysop tool for campaign creation,
  maintenance, and settings management.

/ `nc-game`: The Rust TUI player client for direct localhost sessions.

/ `nc-door`: The Rust BBS door entrypoint. It runs the same game flow as
  `nc-game`, but it is the staged binary for Windows and Linux BBS hosts.

/ `ncgame.db`: The SQLite database that is the runtime source of truth for the
  Rust engine.

/ non-BBS campaign settings: The sysop-managed runtime policy rows stored in
  `ncgame.db` for direct `nc-game` campaigns. They control game name, the
  default compiled-in color set, maintenance metadata, optional alias
  reservations, and a small set of carried-forward classic setup fields.

/ `config.kdl`: Present only for BBS door campaigns. It holds `players` and
  optional seat `reservations`.

// ─── 13. CLI Reference ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

= CLI Reference

== nc-sysop

```
nc-sysop <subcommand> [options]
```

- *`new-game`:* Create a new campaign directory. Direct `nc-game` campaigns use
  `--name`, `--players`, and `--seed`. BBS campaigns use `new-game --bbs` with
  a minimal per-game `config.kdl`.
- *`settings show|set|reserve|unreserve`:* Inspect or edit non-BBS runtime
  policy in `ncgame.db`, or edit BBS seat reservations in per-game
  `config.kdl`.
- *`maint`:* Run one or more maintenance turns against `ncgame.db`.

== nc-game and nc-door

```
nc-game --dir <game_dir> [--player <1-based index>] [options]
nc-door --dir <game_dir> --dropfile <path> [options]
nc-game submit-turn [--check] --dir <game_dir> --player <record> --file <turn.kdl>
```

Use `nc-game` for direct localhost sessions. Use `nc-door` for BBS
door launches. The interactive flags below apply to both binaries unless a host
setup guide says otherwise.

Interactive client flags:

- *`--dir <path>`:* Game directory containing `ncgame.db`. Required.
- *`--player <N>`:* 1-based empire index for direct localhost play.
  Normal BBS dropfile launches can omit it.
- *`--encoding <utf8|cp437>`:* Output encoding. Default: `utf8`. Use `cp437`
  for BBS or door mode.
- *`--color-mode <ansi16|256|truecolor|auto>`:* Color depth. Default: `auto`
  from the environment. CP437 mode defaults to `ansi16`.
- *`--dropfile <path>`:* Parse a BBS drop file (`DOOR32.SYS`, `DOOR.SYS`, or
  `CHAIN.TXT`). It supplies the alias and timeout, defaults encoding to
  `cp437`, and resolves the player seat through BBS `config.kdl` reservations
  or stored joined-player aliases.
- *`--socket-port <value>`:* Connect back to a localhost door socket. Mainly
  for ENiGMA½ `abracadabra` in `socket` mode.
- *`--socket-descriptor <value>`:* Native Windows door socket handle. Mainly
  for Synchronet-style socket door launches.
- *`--timeout <minutes>`:* Session time limit in minutes. It overrides any
  drop file value.
- *`--export-root <path>`:* Optional map or export staging root for local or
  BBS file handoff workflows.
- *`--queue-dir <path>`:* Override turn queue directory. Default:
  `<game_dir>/queue`.

`submit-turn` flags:

- *`--check`:* Validate the KDL file without mutating the campaign.
- *`--dir <path>`:* Game directory containing `ncgame.db`. Required.
- *`--player <N>`:* 1-based empire index. Required, and it must match the KDL
  header.
- *`--file <path>`:* Turn submission KDL file to validate or apply. Required.

#admonition("NOTE")[`nc-game submit-turn` is all-or-nothing. If any command in the file is invalid, the entire submission is rejected and nothing is written to `ncgame.db`.]
