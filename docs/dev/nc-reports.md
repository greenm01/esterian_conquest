# NC Report Spec

This doc is the canonical player-facing report spec for the Rust engine.

Use it to guide report wording, format, and family-specific presentation across
`nc-engine`, `nc-cli`, and `nc-game`.

Read this together with:

- [ec-timing-spec.md](ec-timing-spec.md)
  for `Stardate` placement and weekly assignment
- [nc-combat-spec.md](nc-combat-spec.md)
  for combat and hostile-world mechanics
- [rust-turn-cycle-implementation.md](rust-turn-cycle-implementation.md)
  for where reports are emitted in the yearly loop

## Report Policy

The Rust engine uses a hybrid report surface:

- combat and hostile-world aftermath use a structured briefing format
- movement, logistics, intel, and administrative flow stay narrative by default
- repeated join logistics should collapse into one compact Fleet Command summary
- the shell stays consistent across both styles

The report surface is no longer governed by classic EC prose templates. Classic
behavior still matters at the file/export boundary, but Rust report wording is
owned here.

## Shared Shell

Every player-visible report keeps the same outer shell:

- first line: source header plus right-justified `Stardate: <week>/<year>`
- body: one or more wrapped 72-column lines
- final line: lowercase `<end of transmission>`

Shell rules:

- keep the source clause specific: fleet, planet, starbase, or Fleet Command
  Center
- fleet-origin reports must name a fleet whenever that identity is known
- use full ship names, not abbreviations such as `BB`, `CA`, or `DD`
- wrap on word boundaries
- preserve explicit blank separator lines in structured reports

## Format Choice

Use the report family to choose the body style.

### Structured Reports

Use structured reports when the player is comparing multiple facts in one event:

- fleet battles
- Fleet Command Center lost-fleet and lost-starbase combat aftermath
- bombardment reports
- invasion reports
- blitz reports
- defender-side captured-world reports

Structured body shape:

```text
[family title]

[context rows]

[force or defense rows]

[short outcome lines]
```

Rules:

- use left-justified labeled rows
- group structured combat reports into three sections after the title:
  context rows, force/defense rows, then outcomes
- use blank lines between title and each non-empty section
- outcome lines should be short and direct
- do not restate facts already shown in the labeled rows
- prefer labels such as `Our forces:`, `Alien forces:`, `Our defenses:`,
  `Attacking force:`, `Our losses:`, and `Enemy losses:`
- keep `Fleet lost:`, `Starbase lost:`, `Last contact:`, `Enemy:`,
  `Attacker:`, `Invader:`, and `Target world:` in the context section
- for Fleet Command Center destruction telemetry, prefer `destroyed by ...`
  or `destroyed while intercepting ...` over `was attacked by ...`
- emit the same lost-contact telemetry family when a bombardment, invasion, or
  blitz assault force is completely destroyed
- when all initial planetary defenses are eliminated, prefer
  `All planetary defenses were destroyed.`

### Narrative Reports

Use narrative reports when the player is following a single event flow rather
than scanning a comparison:

- move / patrol / seek-home / join / rendezvous reports
- except that per-turn `JoinAnotherFleet` churn should be summarized once from
  Fleet Command instead of emitting one notice per affected fleet
- retarget and follow-on notices
- colonization and salvage reports
- most abort notices
- administrative and validation notices

Rules:

- prefer one clear event sentence followed by only the minimum supporting
  detail
- avoid clause chains that repeat the same fact with slightly different words
- keep the tone report-like, not bureaucratic

### Hybrid Intel Reports

Scouting and viewing reports may mix a short narrative lead-in with compact
fact rows when that reads better than either pure style.

Use hybrid formatting for dense intel only when the extra structure materially
improves readability.

## Style Rules

- keep viewpoint consistent within a report
- use first person for the viewer's own forces and status
- use direct, concrete wording over filler
- avoid robotic stitch-phrases like `Our defenses had X. We lost X.` when a
  single outcome line can say the same thing
- avoid freeform flourish; the tone should still feel like a concise
  transmission
- use labels for factual inventory, not for obvious one-step narrative events

Zero-count rules:

- do not emit `0 ground battery(ies)` or `0 army(ies)`
- use `none`, `undefended`, or a family-specific zero phrase instead
- omit meaningless zero-loss prose

## Family Guidance

### Combat And Hostile-World Reports

These should optimize for scanability. A player should be able to find:

- who engaged whom
- force composition
- defenses
- outcome
- friendly losses
- enemy losses

Prefer one short outcome sentence plus labeled loss rows over paragraph-style
battle narration.

### Movement And Logistics Reports

These should optimize for event flow. A player should be able to read them as a
status update:

- what changed
- where the fleet now is
- what happens next

Do not convert simple movement/retarget/status notices into form-like blocks
unless they become fact-dense enough to justify it.

### Intel Reports

These should present findings without sounding like a database dump.

Use a brief narrative lead-in, then compact fact presentation only for the
world/fleet details that matter to planning.

## Examples

### Structured Battle Report

```text

Interception successful.
The enemy fled the field.

Alien losses:      2 cruisers and 1 destroyer
<end of transmission>
```

```

### Hybrid Intel Report

```text

Owned by:           Empire #2
Potential production: 100 points
Estimated production: 73 points
Number of armies:   7

<end of transmission>
```

## Implementation Rule

When Rust report wording and older classic prose differ:

- follow this doc for player-facing Rust behavior
- keep classic compatibility requirements in
  [classic-results-dat-compat.md](classic-results-dat-compat.md)
- do not reintroduce classic paragraph wording as the default authority unless
  there is a deliberate product decision to do so
