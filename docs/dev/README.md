# Developer Documentation

This directory holds the current engineering docs for Esterian Conquest.

Use this file as the entrypoint. It tells you which docs are authoritative for
Rust implementation, which ones are workflow guides, and which ones are
reference/background only.

## Canonical Rust Implementation Docs

These are the docs that should drive engine/client behavior.

- [ec-turn-cycle-spec.md](ec-turn-cycle-spec.md)
  - canonical oracle-backed yearly maintenance ordering

  - implementation-facing Rust companion for the turn cycle
- [nc-combat-spec.md](nc-combat-spec.md)
  - canonical Rust combat and hostile world-resolution mechanics
- [ec-timing-spec.md](ec-timing-spec.md)
  - weekly scheduler and `Stardate` behavior
- [economics.md](economics.md)

- [ghidra-workflow.md](ghidra-workflow.md)
  - Ghidra investigation workflow
- [dosbox-workflow.md](dosbox-workflow.md)
  - DOSBox-based oracle/dynamic investigation workflow
- [fixtures.md](fixtures.md)
  - fixture layout and intended usage
- [localhost-nc-host.md](localhost-nc-host.md)
  - dev-only localhost hosted lab for `nc-host` + `nc-dash`
- [harness/README.md](harness/README.md)
  - typed KDL and CLI workflow for campaign play, runtime scenarios, combat scenarios, and combat sweeps
- [harness/campaign-play.md](harness/campaign-play.md)
  - reproducible conductor workflow for "play to turn N, then inspect in the TUI"
- [llm-player-guide.md](llm-player-guide.md)
  - strict visible-state operating guide for bots/LLMs playing real campaigns

## Reference And Background Docs

These docs are useful inputs, but they are not the source of truth for Rust
behavior by themselves.

- [ecmaint-combat-reference.md](ecmaint-combat-reference.md)
  - historical combat-oriented oracle/reference notes
- [planet-report-reference.md](planet-report-reference.md)
  - report-side target-world reference profiles
- [classic-results-dat-compat.md](classic-results-dat-compat.md)
  - classic `RESULTS.DAT` binary/export compatibility contract
- [bbs_door_client_rust.md](bbs_door_client_rust.md)
  - client/delivery direction for the SQLite-native Rust player-side stack
- [config-architecture.md](config-architecture.md)
  - KDL/config extraction boundaries and sequencing
- [llm-test-harness.md](llm-test-harness.md)
  - original DOS/BBS black-box automation notes for RE-oriented LLM play

## Reading Order

For gameplay/engine work:

1. [next-session.md](next-session.md)
2. [approach.md](approach.md)
3. [rust-architecture.md](rust-architecture.md)
4. the canonical spec docs listed above for the subsystem you are touching

For client/UI work:

1. [next-session.md](next-session.md)
2. [bbs_door_client_rust.md](bbs_door_client_rust.md)
3. [nc-game-prompt-standard.md](nc-game-prompt-standard.md)
4. [rust-architecture.md](rust-architecture.md)

## Doc Policy

- keep authoritative Rust behavior in the canonical spec docs
- keep `next-session.md` short and current
- keep historical notebooks and bulky RE detail in `archive/`
- keep reference docs clearly labeled when they are useful but non-canonical
