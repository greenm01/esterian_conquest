//! Canonical EC combat resolution.
//!
//! The structure here owes an explicit debt to *Empire of the Sun*: both sides
//! compute their blows from the same moment in time, and only then does the
//! board reckon with the cost. That simultaneous exchange fits EC's manuals
//! better than file-order skirmishes, while staying seeded and reproducible
//! for Rust maintenance and classic save compatibility.
