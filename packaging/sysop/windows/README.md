# Nostrian Conquest Windows Sysop Package

This is the public Windows x64 BBS/sysop package. It contains
`nc-door.exe`, `nc-sysop.exe`, both public PDF manuals, the shipped
`docs/sysop/` markdown guides, `config.kdl`, and `BUILD-INFO.txt`. It does
not contain `nc-game.exe`, and it does not bundle preserved Esterian
Conquest executables, manuals, or DOS helper files.

Use this package when you are hosting Nostrian Conquest as a native Windows
BBS door. If you want localhost or direct console play on Windows, build from
source and use `nc-game.exe`. If you want the VPS/Nostr daemon stack, build
from tagged source on Linux and use `scripts/install_vps.sh`.

## BBS Quick Start

1. Choose a game directory and copy `config.kdl` into it. Adjust `players`
   and any `reservations`, then initialize the BBS campaign:

```text
nc-sysop.exe new-game --bbs C:\nc\games\night-shift
```

2. If you want a reproducible test map, keep the seed on the command line:

```text
nc-sysop.exe new-game --bbs C:\nc\games\night-shift --seed 1515
```

3. Point the BBS door at `nc-door.exe` with the dropfile path:

```text
nc-door.exe --dir C:\nc\games\night-shift --dropfile <dropfile>
```

4. On native Windows Synchronet, pass the inherited socket descriptor too:

```text
nc-door.exe --dir C:\nc\games\night-shift --dropfile %f --socket-descriptor %H
```

For working host-specific entries, see the bundled Mystic, Synchronet,
ENiGMA½, and WWIV setup guides under `docs/sysop/`.

## Notes

New unreserved BBS callers land on the first-time menu. Reserved callers and
returning callers skip that generic first-time screen. The signed
`SHA256SUMS.txt` manifest on the GitHub release page covers this package.
